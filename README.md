## About my app

I have developed an application so that as soon as the user writes their names and phone numbers to save their friends in their contacts, they are listed just above it.
The user will be able to both delete the items in the list and edit the information of the people registered by the user.
There is also a detail showing how many people are on the list.
And finally a warning message will pop up whenever the user tries to delete an element in the list.
